# TrailApp

### The what

(_What is this project about?_)

Trail is an open-source user analytics and event tracking platform for your sites.
With Trail, you can get insights to into the userbase of your website - info on the most visited pages, info on the demographics of the users etc.

### The how

(_Instructions to run locally_)

 1. Clone the repo
 2. Run the MySQL, ClickHouse and Redis  
    If you use docker, then do `$ docker-compose up clickhouse-server mysql redis`  
   If you're are not using docker-compose, then you'll have to setup the DBs.
   The scripts are in `database_scripts/`
 3. Install the dependencies and run the server

 ```bash
 $ virtualenv trail-venv --python=python3
 $ source trail-venv/bin/activate
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 $ flask run
 ```

 You can configure ports and authentication in `config.py`, or by setting them in the enviroment or `.flaskenv`

### The stack

(_What did you use to build this?_)

The current version is built using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) for database.  
[Redis](https://redis.io/) is used for caching.

### The internals
(_Some thoughts on the development and working_)

**Why ClickHouse?**
Trail was originally written completely with MySQL and then later migrated to ClickHouse.

Before looking into the database chosen, consider the nature of the data to be stored by the application

![](.github/assets/data.png)

Of these, the second one is almost entirely immutable data - once entered, it cannot change, but we'll constantly be doing queries on it.

ClickHouse is a DBMS system specifically optimised and designed for exactly these type of data -  immutable, but requires frequent analysis. It is an OLAP system as opposed to OLTP system (like MySQL)

So, since ClickHouse is great for analytics (and it was something new to learn), ClickHouse is used for the logs and the others are retained in MySQL


**How everything fits together?**

The diagram above depicts the flow of the program.

Once a user is setup and has configured their site with Trail, the site starts generating logs
and it will be updated in realtime in the dashboard.

The overall flow is relatively simple.
Whenever a visitor visits the site setup with Trail, 
it sends a events through the API, which is processed and validated by the Flask server and logs the entry into ClickHouse.

The site data gets updated in realtime with the help of
Clickhouse's fast on-the-fly reporting capabilities

### The why
(_Why did we work on this project?_)

For fun and to learn!
(and we had to submit a project for school :sweat_smile: )

### TODOs

- [x] Re-organise code
- [ ] Abstract the database interactions - consider using an ORM/query builder
- [ ] Expand the documentation

### Credits

- Thanks to the [Argon](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/argon-dashboard) project, based on which the frontend is built.
